# Emerging-Technologies

# Introduction:
This git repository contains the code for GMIT 4th year module - Emerging Technologies.

The code will be written in python using jupyter notebooks and flask. The objective is to train a model using the Tensorflow framework and the Keras library to recognize hand written digits using MNIST Dataset.

## Running project code

## To run this project :

Download repository to local folder.

Make sure python 3.6 or greater installed on your machine.

Project was developed with Anaconda set-up and is recommended. Link to website below.

If Anaconda installed, start Anaconda navigator application added with Anaconda download.

Click on environments tab on Anaconda navigator and create new virtual environment.

Once Virtual environment created add the following python packages to environment:

* keras

* tensorflow

* numpy

* matplotlib

* sklearn

* flask

* PIL or pillow. python image library

* All other imports should come as standard with python installed

## IDE instruction:

### Jupyter Notebooks:

The model was trained using jupyter notebooks which come installed with anaconda and can be accessed through Anaconda navigator also.

Otherwise you can run the command jupyter-notebook or jupyter lab from a command prompt inside the jupyter folder of the repository and wait for the notebooks to open in your web browser.

### Flask App:

This project was developed using VS Code for flask, python, HTML and javascript development.

To run flask app open flask folder in VS Code.

Open integrated terminal in VS Code. May have to open a second terminal to activate anaconda in terminal.

If anaconda activated in terminal run command - source activate "your-virtual-environment-name". should work on Windows/ Linux / Mac

In VS Code be sure to select the python interpreter as your virtual environment. To change this use command: ctrl - Shift - P to check if your python interpreter is the same as your virtual environment.

If all is working fine and you have no import errors with python code app is ready to run.

In flask folder run command export FLASK_APP=app.py, then enter command flask run.

If flask started without any errors go to localhost:5000 in web browser and application should be visible and ready to use.

## Anaconda/Python:
All code used will be based around python and installed using the Anaconda package manager. Anaconda will be able to install all needed packages to complete this project. Anaconda comes with jupyter notebooks installed and this will be our main python IDE.

## Jupyter Notebooks:
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code. This will be used as our environment to write majority of python code to train our model.

## Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.

## Tensorflow

TensorFlow is a free software library focused on machine learning created by Google. Initially released as part of the Apache 2.0 open-source license, TensorFlow was originally developed by engineers and researchers of the Google Brain Team.

## Keras

Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.

## MNIST

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.
