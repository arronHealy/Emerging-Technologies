# Emerging-Technologies

# Introduction:
This git repository contains the code for GMIT 4th year module - Emerging Technologies.

The code will be written in python using jupyter notebooks and flask. The objective is to train a model using the Tensorflow framework and the Keras library to recognize hand written digits using MNIST Dataset.

# Technology links:
- Anaconda/Python

- Jupyter Notebooks

- Flask

- Tensorflow

- Keras

- MNIST


## Anaconda/Python:
All code used will be based around python and installed using the Anaconda package manager. Anaconda will be able to install all needed packages to complete this project. Anaconda comes with jupyter notebooks installed and this will be our main python IDE.

## Jupyter Notebooks:
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code. This will be used as our environment to write majority of python code to train our model.
